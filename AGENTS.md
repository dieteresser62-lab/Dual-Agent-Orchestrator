## Execution Policy
- For actionable development tasks, start implementation immediately.
- Do not ask for confirmation first.
- Only ask clarifying questions when:
  - Requirements are technically unclear,
  - Multiple valid directions with different trade-offs exist,
  - Permissions/secrets/external escalation approval are needed,
  - A potentially destructive action is pending.
- After changes, automatically run relevant tests/lint.
- Report results briefly (changes, test status, open risks).
